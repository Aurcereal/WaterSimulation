Seb Lague Vid

- Maybe higher smoothing radius just for density texture or blur it in some way
- Implement linked list method for springs (detailed below)
- 3D Object Repeller/Attractor objects or can use raycasting to transfer mouse force to 3D

-=Ignore/Done for now=-

- Surface Tension from one of those papers (didn't turn out well for now..)
- Springs are a big nxn matrix currently, that can get massive so can cut down to an 'adjacency list' which will just be stored as like an nx200 matrix where row i stores particles that are within smoothing distance of particle i (since it won't be much).  Can store length for each row.
- Elasticity from ligum paper section 5 (implemented)
- Sim Parameters has 'Initialization' header section with particle count, spawn zone... etc... and whether to use springs (so we can avoid creating big buffer sometimes)
- Rectangle w/ Arb transform Collision (or just sdfs lol)
- Try SDF stickiness (Clavet 6.2 maybe can ignore fact that my collision resolution is very simpler just add sticky force)
