gridsize = h/sqrt(2)

write about optimizations to run in realtime

Seb Lague Vid

- Check correctness of attributes like f, normal and normal in refracted dirs, try playing around with lower densities and different coeffs, use nicer step size (and make notes to optimize later)-
- QoL like pausing sim and stepping frame by frame, also camera controller prolly arcball or smth

- Try using golf and unsafe versions of smoothing kernels/gradients
- Group density and neardensity as a float2 (less reads and writes)
- Implement linked list method for springs (detailed below)

- 3D Object Repeller/Attractor objects or can use raycasting to transfer mouse force to 3D
- Sticky magnet with springs, different types of liquids like ketchup or goop could be cool visuals

- Extreme viscosity so like a fluid box will stay together (very very strong springs?)
- Can turn a arb mesh into fluid so it'd be kinda like soft body sim lol

-=Ignore/Done for now=-

- Surface Tension from one of those papers (didn't turn out well for now..)
- Springs are a big nxn matrix currently, that can get massive so can cut down to an 'adjacency list' which will just be stored as like an nx200 matrix where row i stores particles that are within smoothing distance of particle i (since it won't be much).  Can store length for each row.
- Elasticity from ligum paper section 5 (implemented)
- Sim Parameters has 'Initialization' header section with particle count, spawn zone... etc... and whether to use springs (so we can avoid creating big buffer sometimes)
- Rectangle w/ Arb transform Collision (or just sdfs lol)
- Try SDF stickiness (Clavet 6.2 maybe can ignore fact that my collision resolution is very simpler just add sticky force)
