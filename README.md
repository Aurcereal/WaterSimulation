During the summer of 2025, I made a realtime fluid simulation and renderer in Unity.  The features include

- Particle-Based Fluid Simulation based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) run using Compute Shaders
- Physically Based Raymarched Fluid Renderer written with HLSL
- Physically Based Screenspace Fluid Renderer written with HLSL (faster than raymarched but not as accurate)
- Particle-Based Foam Simulation for crashing waves run using Compute Shaders
- Foam rendering using using volumetric raymarching or billboard sprites written with HLSL
- Raymarched Rendered Caustics and Shadows
- Screenspace Rendered Caustics and Shadows
- Spatial Hashing and different GPU sorting algorithms to allow the simulation to run at high framerates
